# Superdoku
A very quick and simple project to solve Sudokus in Python

This is a little project for fun: a basic approach to solve Sudokus in Python

It can only solve 2D Sudokus, but of any size. It checks the validity of the input array and returns
the first solution found (if any). If no solution is found, it raises an exception.
